## Changes in hooks

If modified the code, e.g. by adding a custom extension module, you might want to update your handlers to the following hooks. You can find them in the `mongoose_hooks` module.

* We refactored the MAM (XEP-0313) implementation, replacing the long lists of arguments accepted by the `mam_archive_message` and `mam_muc_archive_message` hooks with a more readable key-value structure (a map).
* The argument list of the `failed_to_store_message` hook has been changed as a result of code refactoring.
