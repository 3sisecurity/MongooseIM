## DB migrations

### Inbox indexes

Domain removal feature requires the order of fields to be changed:

For Postgres:

```sql
-- Create a new index for the new primary key.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX i_inbox_sur ON inbox (lserver, luser, remote_bare_jid);

-- Now enter a transaction block to replace the primary with the new one.
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE inbox DROP CONSTRAINT inbox_pkey;
ALTER TABLE inbox ADD CONSTRAINT inbox_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX i_inbox_sur;
COMMIT;

CREATE INDEX i_inbox_timestamp
    ON inbox
    USING BTREE(lserver, luser, timestamp);
DROP INDEX i_inbox;
```

For MySQL:

```sql
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE inbox DROP PRIMARY KEY;
ALTER TABLE inbox ADD PRIMARY KEY USING BTREE(lserver, luser, remote_bare_jid);
COMMIT;

CREATE INDEX i_inbox_timestamp ON inbox(lserver, luser, timestamp);
DROP INDEX i_inbox ON inbox;
```

For MSSQL:

```sql
CREATE INDEX i_inbox_su_ts ON inbox(lserver, luser, timestamp);
GO

DROP INDEX i_inbox_ts ON inbox;
GO

ALTER TABLE inbox DROP CONSTRAINT PK_inbox;
GO

ALTER TABLE inbox ADD CONSTRAINT PK_inbox PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED(
        lserver ASC, luser ASC, remote_bare_jid ASC);
GO
```

### MUC-light indexes

Order of fields in `i_muc_light_blocking` has changed.

For Postgres:

```sql
CREATE INDEX i_muc_light_blocking_su ON muc_light_blocking (lserver, luser);
DROP INDEX i_muc_light_blocking;
```

For MySQL:

```sql
CREATE INDEX i_muc_light_blocking_su USING BTREE ON muc_light_blocking (lserver, luser);
DROP INDEX i_muc_light_blocking ON muc_light_blocking;;
```

For MSSQL:

```sql
CREATE INDEX i_muc_light_blocking_su ON muc_light_blocking (lserver, luser);
GO

DROP INDEX i_muc_light_blocking ON muc_light_blocking;
GO
```


## Groupchat hook migrations

- `filter_room_packet` hook uses a map instead of a proplist
  for the event data information.
- `room_send_packet` hook has been removed. Use `filter_room_packet` instead.
- `filter_room_packet` is called for HostType (was for MucHost).
- `forget_room` is called for HostType (was for MucHost).
- `forget_room` takes an extra argument HostType.
- `filter_room_packet` takes an extra argument HostType.
- `is_muc_room_owner` is called for HostType (was for MucHost).
- `is_muc_room_owner` takes an extra argument HostType.
- `muc_room_pid` hook removed.
- `load_permanent_rooms_at_startup` option is ignored now.

## Metrics REST API (obsolete)

The API is still considered obsolete so if you are using it,
please consider using [WombatOAM](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/capabilities/wombatoam/)
or metrics reporters as described in [Logging and monitoring](../operation-and-maintenance/Logging-&-monitoring.md).

In each endpoint, `host` has been changed to `host_type`.
This is because the metrics are now collected per host type rather than host.
