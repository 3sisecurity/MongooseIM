## Configuration changes

The configuration format has slightly changed and you might need to amend `mongooseim.toml`.

### Section `auth`

Each authentication method needs a TOML section, e.g. if you have the `rdbms` method enabled, you need to have the `[auth.rdbms]` section in the configuration file, even if it is empty. The `methods` option is not required anymore and especially if you are using only one method, you can remove it. See the [configuration](../configuration/auth.md) for details.

### Section `host_config`

The rules for overriding global options in the `host_config` section have been simplified. The `auth` section and the `s2s.address`, `s2s.domain_certfile` and `s2s.shared` options now completely override the corresponding general settings instead of being merged with them.
