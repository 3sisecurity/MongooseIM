## Configuration changes

The configuration format has slightly changed and you might need to amend `mongooseim.toml`.

### Section `acl`

The implicit check for user's domain in patterns is now configurable and the default behaviour (previously undocumented) is more consistent - the check is always performed unless disabled with `match = "all"`.
See the description of [`current_domain`](../configuration/acl.md#aclmatch) for more details.

### Section `auth`

* Each authentication method needs a TOML section, e.g. if you have the `rdbms` method enabled, you need to have the `[auth.rdbms]` section in the configuration file, even if it is empty. The `methods` option is not required anymore and especially if you are using only one method, you can remove it.
* The `auth.scram_iterations` option was moved to [`auth.password.scram_iterations`](../configuration/auth.md#authpasswordscram_iterations).

See the [auth configuration](../configuration/auth.md) for details.

### Section `host_config`

The rules for overriding global options in the `host_config` section have been simplified. The `auth` section and the `s2s.address`, `s2s.domain_certfile` and `s2s.shared` options now completely override the corresponding general settings instead of being merged with them.

## Async workers

The `async_writer` flag of MAM is now a section on its own, that absorbs previous flags related to it: `flush_interval`, `max_batch_size` and `pool_size` now become subelements of the `async_writer` section, with one more parameter, `enabled`. Below an example:

```toml
[modules.mod_mam_meta]
  flush_interval = 1000
  max_batch_size = 100
  muc.async_writer = false
```
now becomes
```toml
[modules.mod_mam_meta]
  async_writer.flush_interval = 1000
  async_writer.batch_size = 100
  muc.async_writer.enabled = false
```
