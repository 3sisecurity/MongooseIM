## Hooks

Hook names have been unified by removing the `_hook` prefix from the few hooks which used it,
e.g. `offline_message_hook` is now called `offline_message`. This change affects the hook metric names as well.

## Listener configuration

`listen.c2s.c2s_state_timeout` option has been renamed to [listen.c2s.state_timeout](../listeners/listen-c2s.md#listenc2sstate_timeout).
