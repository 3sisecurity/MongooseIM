## **`odbc` renamed to `rdbms` in module names and options**

* **For MongooseIM users:** simply replace all instances of `odbc` in your config files with `rdbms`.
  E.g. `{auth_method, odbc}.` would now be `{auth_method, rdbms}.`.<br/>
  It's also important to note that all metrics that previously contained `odbc` in their names have also been renamed to contain `rdbms` instead.

* **For developers calling MongooseIM modules:** most modules, functions and atoms had `odbc` in their names replaced with `rdbms`.
  The only exceptions to this rule were names actually pertaining to the ODBC driver, e.g. `mongoose_rdbms_odbc`.

## **`ejabberd.cfg` renamed to `mongooseim.cfg`**

Rename the existing config file of MongooseIM from `ejabberd.cfg` to `mongooseim.cfg`.

## Pools configuration

Configuring pools to external services has changed, please see [Outgoing Connection doc](../advanced-configuration/outgoing-connections.md) for more details.

NOTE: Keep in mind that outgoing_pools is a list of pools, it may turn out that you will have more than one entry in the list when more than a single outgoing pool is needed.

### ElasticSearch configuration migration

Change the existing entry in the configuration file:

```erlang
{elasticsearch_server, [{host, "elastic.host.com"}, {port, 9042}]}.
```

to:

```erlang
{outgoing_pools, [
 {elastic, global, default, [], [{host, "elastic.host.com"}, {port, 9042}]}
]}.
```

### RDBMS configuration migration

RDBMS pools are no longer configured by a `{pool, odbc, _}` tuple, instead using the generic outgoing pools mechanism.
The connection configuration is now passed via `server` option of the pool insted of being configured via a top-level `{odbc_server, _}` tuple.
Similarly, the number of workers is no longer configured by `odbc_pool_size`, and the default pool no longer set by `odbc_pool`.
A top-level `odbc_keepalive_interval` is now also specified as an option for a specific pool.
For example:

```erlang
{odbc_pool_size, 10}.
{pool, odbc, default}.
{odbc_server_type, mssql}.
{odbc_server, "DSN=mongoose-mssql;UID=sa;PWD=mongooseim_secret+ESL123"}.
{odbc_keepalive_interval, 10}.
```

will now become:

```erlang
{rdbms_server_type, mssql}.
{outgoing_pools, [
 {rdbms, global, default, [{workers, 10}],
  [{server, "DSN=mongoose-mssql;UID=sa;PWD=mongooseim_secret+ESL123"}, {keepalive_interval, 10}]}
]}.
```

Note that `odbc_server_type` was only renamed to `rdbms_server_type` and still remains a top-level configuration value.
