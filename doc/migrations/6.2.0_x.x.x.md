## Database migration

There is a new column in the `mam_message` table in the database, which is used to support including or excluding groupchat results in a user archive. See the migrations for Postgres, MySQL and MSSQL in the [`priv/migrations`](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/tree/master/priv/migrations) directory. Please be aware that the filtering process will only be effective for new messages and will not apply to those messages that have already been stored in the database.
