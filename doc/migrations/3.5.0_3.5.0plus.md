## Different MUC Light room schema definition

Separate MUC Light options for the schema and default values were somewhat unintuitive and led to problems with RDBMS backend.
When the default config was a subset of the schema and the client hasn't provided these values when a room was created, it caused incomplete config being stored in the table.
Due to this bug, the missing config fields couldn't even be re-added by the clients.
If you've experienced this issue, a way to fix it is described in the [Known issues](../operation-and-maintenance/known-issues.md) page.

The current method makes it impossible to make the same mistake, as it disallows field definition without any default value.

### What has changed? - for administrators

* It's no longer possible to declare room config field only with its name.
* There is no `default_config` option anymore.
* Declaring field name and type without atom key is no longer supported.

#### Examples

```
{config_schema, [
                 "roomname",
                 "subject",
                 "background",
                 "notification_sound"
                ]},
{default_config, [
                  {"roomname", "The room"},
                  {"subject", "Chit-chat"}
                 ]}

becomes

{config_schema, [
                 {"roomname", "The room"},
                 {"subject", "Chit-chat"},
                 {"background", ""},
                 {"notification_sound", ""}
                ]}
```

```
{config_schema, [
                 "roomname",
                 {"subject", binary},
                 {"priority", priority, integer},
                 {"owners-height", owners_height, float}
                ]},
{default_config, [
                  {"roomname", "The room"},
                  {"subject", "Chit-chat"},
                  {"priority", 10}]}

becomes

{config_schema, [
                 {"roomname", "The room"},
                 {"subject", "Chit-chat"},
                 {"priority", 10, priority, integer},
                 {"owners-height", 180.0, owners_height, float}
                ]}
                 
```

### What has changed? - for developers

The room config schema is currently stored in a completely different data structure, so if you have any custom modules that use it, you'll need to adjust them.
What is more, all definitions and the room config API have been extracted from `mod_muc_light.hrl` and `mod_muc_light_utils.erl` into `mod_muc_light_room_config.erl` module.

For more information, please check the types and functions specs in the aforementioned file.

### What hasn't changed?

* The default room config is still the same, i.e. `roomname` (default: `"Untitled"`) and `subject` (empty string).
* The room config representation in databases (both Mnesia and RDBMS) is the same; no need for migration.
