## Configuration

The `mod_mam_meta` module is now named `mod_mam` for simplicity, so if you are using this module, you need to update the module name in `mongooseim.toml`.

## Metrics

The `mod_mam` backend module is now named `mod_mam_pm` for consistency with `mod_mam_muc`. As a result, the backend metrics have updated names, i.e. each `[backends, mod_mam, Metric]` name is changed to `[backends, mod_mam_pm, Metric]`, where `Metric` can be `lookup` or `archive`.

## Rest API

All the backend administration endpoints for `mod_muc_light` require now `XMPPMUCHost` (MUC subdomain) instead of `XMPPHost` (domain) and `roomID` instead of `roomName`.

For some endpoints, the response messages may be slightly different because of the unification with other APIs.

## CTL

For some commands, the response messages may be slightly different because of the unification with other APIs.

## Dynamic domains

Removing a domain was a potentially troublesome operation: if the removal was to fail midway through the process, retrials wouldn't be accepted. This is fixed now, by first disabling and marking a domain for removal, then running all the handlers, and only on full success will the domain be removed. So if any failure is notified, the whole operation can be retried again.

The database requires a migration, as the status of a domain takes now more than the two values a boolean allows, see the migrations for Postgres, MySQL and MSSQL in the [`priv/migrations`](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/tree/master/priv/migrations) directory.
