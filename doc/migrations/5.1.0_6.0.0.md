## Configuration

The `mod_mam_meta` module is now named `mod_mam` for simplicity, so if you are using this module, you need to update the module name in `mongooseim.toml`.

## Metrics

The `mod_mam` backend module is now named `mod_mam_pm` for consistency with `mod_mam_muc`. As a result, the backend metrics have updated names, i.e. each `[backends, mod_mam, Metric]` name is changed to `[backends, mod_mam_pm, Metric]`, where `Metric` can be `lookup` or `archive`.

## Rest API

All the backend administration endpoints for `mod_muc_light` require now `XMPPMUCHost` (MUC subdomain) instead of `XMPPHost` (domain) and `roomID` instead of `roomName`.

For some endpoints, the response messages may be slightly different because of the unification with other APIs.

## CTL

For some commands, the response messages may be slightly different because of the unification with other APIs.
