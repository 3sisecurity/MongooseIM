## HTTP File Upload

[HTTP File Upload](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html) specification older than 0.3.0 is no longer supported, i.e. the one namespaced with `urn:xmpp:http:upload`.
Currently, only the `urn:xmpp:http:upload:0` XMLNS is served.

All major, modern client libraries and applications support the 0.3.0+ specification.
If you experience any issues with making requests to the HTTP File Upload service, please update your client.
