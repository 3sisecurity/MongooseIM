## Internal databases

So far MongooseIM has been using the internal Mnesia database to replicate the in-memory data between cluster nodes.
Now there is an option to use [CETS](https://github.com/esl/cets/) instead.
Mnesia is still used by default, so you don't need to change your configuration file.
If you want to switch to CETS, see [`internal_databases`](../configuration/internal-databases.md).
